# Drawaria AutoDrawer

Drawaria AutoDrawer is a Python-based application that automates the process of drawing images using mouse movements. Built with `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `pyautogui` for mouse automation, this tool is perfect for artists, hobbyists, or anyone interested in creating digital art programmatically.
